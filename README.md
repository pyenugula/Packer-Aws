üöÄ Building AMIs on AWS with Packer and Ansible: Streamlining Nginx Deployment! üåê
I‚Äôm excited to share my recent journey of leveraging HashiCorp Packer and Ansible to automate the creation of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with Nginx pre-installed. This process not only simplified my deployment workflow but also ensured consistency across environments.

Here‚Äôs how I did it:
1. Creating the Packer Template: I started by defining a Packer template in JSON format. This template specifies the base AMI, the provisioning steps, and the necessary configurations.<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 at 23 39 30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbdb5c97-aef8-4d94-91bd-ce62d0d08bb0" />

2. Using Ansible for Nginx Installation: I wrote an Ansible playbook (nginx.yml) that automates the installation and configuration of Nginx. This ensures that the web server is properly set up every time the AMI is built.

3. Building the AMI: With the Packer template and Ansible playbook ready, I executed the build command to create the AMI. This process launches an EC2 instance, runs the Ansible playbook, and captures the image.

4. Running the Instance: After successfully creating the AMI, I used the AWS CLI to launch a new instance from the AMI, applying necessary tags for better management.

This experience has highlighted the power of automation in cloud deployments. By combining Packer and Ansible, I can ensure that my infrastructure is not only reliable but also scalable.
